Methods I need to have access to from anywhere.

isString: Test if first argument is a string.

isObject: Test if first argument is an object. Does not test as object if value is null. Does test as object if string is a String object instance or an Array object instance.

isArray: Test is first argument is an Array object instance. Reports false for a String object instance.
